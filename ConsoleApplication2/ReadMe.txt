In the program cwcreator we were able to complete all tasks that were asked for, our code is easy to understand due to the logic names and to the comments and we prevented failures or abnormal behaviour with inputs.
For this we created 4 classes:
	.Menu;
	.Dictionary;
	.Puzzle;
	.Board.

In the class Menu we have built a menu that is simple and intuitive such that the user can build the crossword puzzle.
The menu is built to be robust, any wrong input will be dealt with and does not break the menu.

The class Dictionary reads a dictionary file and stores the words that are being defined and stores them to a vector of strings.

The class Puzzle 

The class Board contains the color functions and builds a basic board to the requirements of the user and shows said board;
